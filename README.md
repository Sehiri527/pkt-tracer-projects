# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Projects

This private repository showcases a collection of networking simulations designed and configured using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project demonstrates real-world networking concepts including LAN/WAN architecture, dynamic routing protocols, and network security configurations.

## ðŸ“š Projects Included:

### Campus LAN Design
- **Description:** Designed a multi-building LAN network with VLAN segmentation, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing.
- **Technologies Used:** VLANs, VTP, Trunk Links, OSPF Routing.

### WAN Connectivity
- **Description:** Simulated WAN connections across multiple sites using PPP, Frame Relay, and Site-to-Site VPNs.
- **Technologies Used:** PPP, Frame Relay, VPN, Static Routing.

### Network Security Labs
- **Description:** Implemented key security measures including Access Control Lists (ACLs), DHCP Snooping, and Port Security.
- **Technologies Used:** ACLs, DHCP Snooping, Switch Security.
  
### Dynamic Routing Configurations
- **Description:** Configured dynamic routing protocols for optimized network routing.
- **Technologies Used:** OSPF, EIGRP.
